A tool to Bootstrap Chrome extension using React & Webpack


### TODO List:
* Terminate broken ws-connections?
* Use webpack build assets in extension rather than generated from webpack-dev-server. It will omit redundant code and unneeded logs as well as errors
* Prevent background.js from caching. ```chrome.runtime.reload()``` sometimes works - sometimes not
